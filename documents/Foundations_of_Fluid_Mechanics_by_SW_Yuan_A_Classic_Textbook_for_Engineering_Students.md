# Foundations of Fluid Mechanics by S.W. Yuan: A Classic Textbook for Engineering Students
 
Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) and the forces acting on them. Fluid mechanics has many applications in engineering, such as aerodynamics, hydraulics, fluid power, heat transfer, and more. One of the most popular and comprehensive textbooks on fluid mechanics is *Foundations of Fluid Mechanics* by S.W. Yuan.

S.W. Yuan was a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan and a pioneer in fluid mechanics research. He published his first edition of *Foundations of Fluid Mechanics* in 1967[^4^] [^5^] and it has been widely used by engineering students and instructors ever since. The book covers both theoretical and practical aspects of fluid mechanics, with an emphasis on physical understanding and problem-solving skills. The book also includes numerous examples, exercises, and illustrations to help readers grasp the concepts and apply them to real-world situations.
 
*Foundations of Fluid Mechanics* by S.W. Yuan is divided into three parts: Part I introduces the basic principles of fluid mechanics, such as conservation laws, dimensional analysis, similarity, and flow patterns. Part II covers potential flow, viscous flow, boundary layer theory, turbulence, and compressible flow. Part III deals with applications of fluid mechanics, such as pipe flow, open channel flow, drag and lift, flow measurement, and fluid machinery.
 
The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses in fluid mechanics, as well as for self-study and reference. It provides a solid foundation for students who want to pursue further studies or careers in fluid mechanics or related fields. The book is available in hardcover[^5^] and paperback[^6^] formats from various online sources.

*Foundations of Fluid Mechanics* by S.W. Yuan has received positive feedback from both students and instructors who have used it as a textbook or a reference. According to the reviews on Goodreads[^1^] and Amazon[^2^] [^3^], the book is well-written, clear, rigorous, and comprehensive. The reviewers praised the book for its logical organization, its balance between theory and practice, its variety of examples and problems, and its physical insight and intuition. Some of the reviewers also noted that the book is challenging and requires a strong background in mathematics and physics.
 
However, some reviewers also pointed out some drawbacks of the book, such as its outdated notation, its lack of color illustrations, its omission of some topics (such as computational fluid dynamics), and its high price. Some reviewers also suggested that the book could be improved by adding more modern applications, more numerical methods, more worked-out solutions, and more online resources. Some reviewers also recommended supplementing the book with other sources for a more comprehensive and updated coverage of fluid mechanics.
 
Overall, *Foundations of Fluid Mechanics* by S.W. Yuan is a classic textbook that has stood the test of time and still provides a valuable and reliable source of knowledge for engineering students who want to learn fluid mechanics. The book is not perfect and may not suit everyone's needs and preferences, but it is undoubtedly one of the best books on fluid mechanics ever written.
